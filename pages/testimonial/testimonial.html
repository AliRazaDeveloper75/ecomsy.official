          <h2>“Ecomsy transformed our online business!”</h2>
          <p class="content">
            We approached Ecomsy to revamp our outdated Shopify store. Not only
            did they redesign our site beautifully, but they also optimized it
            for mobile and improved loading speed drastically. Our sales
            increased by 40% in just three months! Their team is responsive,
            talented, and always goes above and beyond. We now use their Amazon
            FBA services too!
