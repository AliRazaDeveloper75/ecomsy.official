        <div class="about-content">
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Code Huddle began with a simple idea of digitalising small businesses. We started with something very small, eventually building ourselves into something we pour all of our hearts into.</p>
                <p>What started with an unorganised team of skilled coders is now a one-stop solution for development needs of both startup companies and SMEs. Since our inception, we've come a long way, with our company growing exceptionally, both in the size and complexity of the projects we take.</p>
                <p>As a growing and budding company ourselves, our main target has always been to give distinguished coding solutions to our clients, with a single goal in mind, which is to become the largest, most efficient software development service that caters to projects of all kind.</p>
